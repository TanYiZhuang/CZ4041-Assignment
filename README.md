# CZ4041-Assignment
-Test_data is for converting the dataset into the pickle files that will be used in the actual training of the model as it is faster than having to process the dataset everytime
Replace the trainRoot and testRoot with the path of the datasets, and also the path in line 50 and 54 for the save location of the pickle files.

-PixelDA is the notebook for running the entire trainig code, replace the path/root for the loading of the pickle datasets.
Replace the paths in checkpointPath and sample_images to the path where you would want to save the model checkpoints and the generated images respectively

The entire project is done using the Syn2Real datasets.
